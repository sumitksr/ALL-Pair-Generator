# ALL-Pair-Generator
This repository contains a C++ implementation of an All Pairs Generator, which generates all possible pairs of elements from a given sequence (array, list, or vector). The all-pairs generation problem is useful in various applications combinatorial problems, and solving optimization problems like finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
